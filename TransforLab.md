Personal note to be unfolded by the [TransforLab Incubator](https://trello.com/c/vy4EhfKl/105-transforlab-incubator):

> > TransforMap, a community of communities in the field of commoning
economies, is inviting to TransforLab.

> We openly ask a broad consortium to steward the creation of TransforMap,
a visualization and mapping interface for ~Open Value
Networks~/Alternative Economies + Social Innovation and MMM, the
foundational network of research around internationalized collective
data modelling and federated tempospatial data.

> We will develop neccessary tools for collaborative civic ontology
editing and discussion, provide interoperable and portable Ecosystems of
Applications, Mapping Engines and Hosting infrastructure, create
real-time-ready offline first knowledge federation interfaces and
intervene in local communities, where social innovation is implemented.

> We build on top of our communities needs and help each other by
sustaining previous FP7 CAPS work.

> By that, we implement computational semantics on social semiotics, where
we can show and follow a conversation graph of distributed reasoning.
Further increasing collective intentionality by raising awareness for
meshed processes around us right now and transliterating proven
decentral governance patterns into social space.

> We distill and nurture Living Data Standards, where our Awareness
Platform is the Web itself with its great examples of interoperability.

> From Hypertext to Hypermedia may then mean for us that we find
algorithmic depictions of new modes of economy, that are incubators of a
systemic change towards new institutions and a progressive democracy.

> The process is the product. Masively-scaled Small Data
